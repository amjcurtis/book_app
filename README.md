# Project Name

**Authors**: Andrew Curtis, Tanner Percival
**Version**: 2.0.0

## Overview

We want to create a full-stack app that allows users to search for books using the Google API, and we want to provide a smooth, intuitive browsing experience so users can peruse the results of their search.

## Getting Started

A user must have an internet connection and a modern browser. They will be able to access our site on the web because it will be deployed to Heroku. 

## Architecture

For this app we will be using the following technologies:

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, a templating engine (Handlebars or EJS), Node.js, Express, SQL, PostgreSQL
